# My Vim Configuration

This configuration has been built up over the years and has drawn inspiration more recently from the following folks:

* [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope)
* [Steve Losh](https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/)
* [The Janus project](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)
* [Mislav MarohniÄ‡](https://github.com/mislav/vimfiles)

Plugins are managed via [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
