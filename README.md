# My dotfiles

Using Zsh on Mac OSX.

Cobbled together from a variety of sources over the years.

The bulk of my dotfiles live under the `files` directory.

## Installation

Run `bootstrap.sh` to bootstrap up an OSX machine how I like it. This script relies on Bash and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and are safe to rerun. More details in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).
