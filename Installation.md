# Bootstrap up a macOS box

Use the steps below to stand up a macOS box how I like it.

## Bootstrap up the environment

Firstly it gets the host in shape using [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap) and then fleshes things out with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and [Babushka](http://babushka.me/).

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grassdog/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh)
```

## Configure and Install things via Babushka

Base commands to get things in shape:

```sh
$ babushka personal:loco-osx-settings
$ babushka personal:loco-base
$ babushka personal:loco-dev-env
```

If you've got time up your sleeve you can install all the apps in the world:

```sh
$ babushka personal:brews
$ babushka personal:brew-apps
```

To get your node and Ruby dev on:

```sh
$ babushka personal:loco-node
$ babushka personal:loco-ruby
```

For the bold you can kick it off all at once:

```sh
$ babushka personal:loco
```

Restart host to ensure all settings are in effect.

## Services

Check the status of services via `brew services list`.
